                    Holding an Inception Collection NFT will allow you access to the very first versions of the games. 
                    We've created a storyline for the campaign; decision-based gaming will allow each and every player to 
                    experience slightly different outcomes based on their choices. Alternate metadata subscriptions in the 
                    future will allow for narrative expansion and interesting in-game "games" for players to explore or even 
                    monetize. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Multiplayer version of the game is essentially a place for members of The Resistance to organize into clans or 
                    teams and fight the Modgnik Security Services together. Missions will differ from the Campaign version, and there 
                    will be interesting formats updated regularly. Being a Web3 game allows us to truly take feedback from the community 
                    in a way most AAA-Tier games can not. Owning an Inception Collection NFT will also be your "token" of ownership for the 
                    multiplayer servers. In a perfect world, they're completely decentralized and run by the community.
